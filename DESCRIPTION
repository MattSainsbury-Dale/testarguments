Description: Testing and visualising the predictive performance of an algorithm over a range of argument values. Supports testing of multiple arguments simultaneously. The package is particularly useful for visualising and optimising the predictive performance of a model when the model has several arguments to specify, especially if one suspects an interaction between argument levels.
